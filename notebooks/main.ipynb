      "3 is close to 2² - 1 (4-1=3), then 6 is 3² - 3 (9-3=6). Hmm, but 11 isn't matching any obvious formula here. Maybe not.\n",

      "These don't form an obvious pattern. Let's see if it's increasing by a certain amount each time:\n",

      "From 5 to 8: +3\n",
      "\n",
      "From 8 to 12: +4\n",
      "\n",
      "From 12 to17:+5\n",
      "\n",
      "So the differences between differences are increasing by 1 each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so if I think of second differences being 3,4,5,... then next would be +6.\n",
      "\n",

      "Wait Term2=10 which is the sum up to 4th triangular number (but no).\n",

      "Term4:30=4² +14\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait 4 is not consistent with a pattern here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe term n is something else. Let's think about known sequences starting with 5,10,18,...\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking it up in mind, I recall that these numbers could be related to triangular numbers plus another component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait Term1=5: which is T4 +1 (T4=10), nope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe differences are increasing by more than just linearly. Let me see:\n",
      "\n",
      "From 5 to10:+5\n",
      "\n",
      "From10 to18:+8\n",
      "\n",
      "From18 to30:+12\n",
      "\n",
      "From30 to47:+17\n",
      "\n",
      "So first difference is +5, then +8 (+3), then +12 (+4), then +17 (+5). So the differences between terms are increasing by 3,4,5,...\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, next increase should be +6. Thus, from +17 it becomes +23.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Term6=47+23=70.\n",

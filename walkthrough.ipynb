      "First up is 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ?. Hmm, I notice that each number seems to be increasing, but the gaps between them are getting bigger. From 3 to 6 is +3, then from 6 to 11 it's +5, then +7, +9, and so on. It looks like each time we're adding an odd number, specifically the next odd integer in sequence. So after adding 9, which was from 18 to 27, the next step would be adding 11. Let me check: 27 plus 11 is 38. That seems right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the second sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?. I see that each number increases by more than just a small amount. The differences are 4, 6, 8, 10... These increments themselves seem to be increasing by 2 each time. So after adding 10 to get from 20 to 30, the next increment should be 12. Adding that gives me 42. That makes sense because 2+4=6, 6+6=12, 12+8=20, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the third sequence: 5, 10, 18, 30, 47, ?. This one is trickier. The differences here are 5, 8, 13, 17... Let me see if there's a pattern in those differences. Starting from 5 to 10 is +5, then +8 (which is +3 more than the previous increment), then +13 (+5 more than that), and finally +17 (+4 more). Hmm, that doesn't immediately suggest an obvious mathematical principle like arithmetic or geometric sequences. Maybe it's based on prime numbers? Let me check: 5 isn't a prime, but perhaps it's related to them. Alternatively, maybe each term is the sum of the previous differences plus something else. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's break it down differently. Maybe each term is being added by a Fibonacci-like sequence? Starting from 5, adding 5 gives me 10 (which is correct), then adding 8 (the next in the Fibonacci series) would give me 18. Then adding 13 would bring me to 31, but that's not matching the given third term. Maybe it's a different pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps each difference increases by a certain rule. Let's see: The first two differences are +5 and +8.

      "Maybe the differences themselves have a pattern where each new difference is more than the previous by an increment that increases by one. So from +5 to +8 (+3), then +8 to +13 (+5), then +13 to +? Let's add 5 again: +13 +5 = +18, so next difference would be +18, making the term after 47 as 65. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n",

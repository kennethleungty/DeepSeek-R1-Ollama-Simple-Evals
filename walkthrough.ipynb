      "\n",
      "Oh, I see a pattern here: the increments are increasing by 2 each time. So it's like adding an odd number each step—3, then 5, 7, 9... That makes sense because those are consecutive odd numbers starting from 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "If that continues, the next increment should be +11. Adding 11 to 27 gives us 38.\n",

      "12 to 20 is +8.\n",
      "20 to 30 is +10.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again, each time we're adding an even number that increases by 2: 4, 6, 8, 10... Following this pattern, the next increment should be +12. Adding that to 30 gives us 42.\n",

      "Now the third sequence: 5, 10, 18, 30, 47, ?. The differences here seem a bit trickier.\n",

      "From 5 to 10 is +5.\n",

      "30 to 47 is +17.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, those increments are 5, 8, 12, 17... Let me see if there's a pattern here. The differences between these increments are:\n",
      "\n",
      "From 5 to 8: +3\n",
      "8 to 12: +4\n",
      "12 to 17: +5\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! So the increase in the difference is itself increasing by 1 each time. That means the next increment should be +17 +6 = +23? Wait, no. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's list the increments first: 5,8,12,17.\n",
      "\n",
      "The differences between these are:\n",
      "8-5=3\n",
      "12-8=4\n",
      "17-12=5\n",
      "\n",
      "So each time, we add one more to the difference: +3, then +4, then +5. So next would be adding +6? That seems like it's increasing by 1 each step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, actually the increments themselves are increasing by an additional 1 each time:\n",
      "\n",
      "From 5 (first increment) to 8 is +3\n",
      "Then from 8 to 12 is +4\n",
      "Then from 12 to 17 is +5\n",
      "\n",
      "So next would be adding +6. So if we add 6 to the last increment of +17, that gives us a new increment of +23.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding 23 to 47 should give us 70? Wait, but I think I might have miscounted somewhere because 5+8=13, then +12=25, then +17=42... Hmm, maybe that's not right. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, the sequence is 5,10,18,30,47,...\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 5 and 10: +5\n",
      "10 to 18: +8 (so total so far: 5+8=13)\n",
      "18 to 30: +12 (total increments added up: 5+8+12=25, but the sequence is at 30 now)\n",
      "Wait no, perhaps it's better to see each step as just adding the next increment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if I have:\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with 5\n",
      "Add 5 → 10\n",
      "Add 8 → 18\n",
      "Add 12 → 30\n",
      "Add 17 →47\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the increments: 5,8,12,17. So what's next?\n",
      "\n",
      "The differences between these are +3, +4, +5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems like each increment increases by 1 more than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, after adding 17 (which was an increase of 5 from 12), the next increase should be 6 added to the previous increment (17). So 17+6=23. Therefore, the next number is 47 +23 =70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, because 5 is the first increment, then 8 (+3), then 12 (+4), then 17 (+5). So each time, we add one more to the previous difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "So after adding 5 (increment of 5 from base?), wait this might not be correct. Maybe it's better to model it as a second-level sequence where the differences are increasing by 3,4,5,... So next increment would be +6?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, let me write down:\n",
      "\n",
      "First differences: 5,8,12,17\n",
      "\n",
      "Compute second differences:\n",
      "8-5=3\n",
      "12-8=4\n",
      "17-12=5\n",
      "\n",
      "So the second-level differences are 3,4,5... Thus, next should be +6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the third difference would be 5+6=11?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the first differences (the increments) are themselves increasing by an additional 1 each time: from 5 to 8 (+3), then 8 to 12 (+4), then 12 to 17 (+5). So next increment should be +6.\n",
      "\n",
